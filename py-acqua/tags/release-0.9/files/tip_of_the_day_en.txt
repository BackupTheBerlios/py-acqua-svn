If you're at your first preparement of an aquarium you must follow this advices...Before putting  the water you should already have an idea of the fish that you will insert in. This because every fish have his own esigences and then we have to know if the water of our basin have to be more or less strong. Try to now what values has the water of your tape and than cut it with osmosi water or demineralizated. Another way is to take all osmosis water and than, with the salts that we find in acquariofilia's shops, take it at the wanted values.
